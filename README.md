# PetSuite
PetSuite is a simple example .Net MVC project, using some of the best practices of development during my study of Domain Driven Design pattern.

In this project, i have used:

* Asp.Net MVC 5;

* Entity Framework with code first;

* Bootstrap;

* Domain Driven Design (not full, but i tried to use the idea);

* Some Ajax calls from View to Controller;

* Partial View for Delete Modal;

* Sql Server;

* Dependency Injection - using Ninject;

* Unit of Work for controlling EF SaveChanges;

* Repository Pattern;


____________________________

The project is not completed yet, only a part is developed.

The idea is to build a simple administration system for PetShops
